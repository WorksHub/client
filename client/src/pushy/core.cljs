;; This is our version of pushy
;; (https://github.com/kibu-australia/pushy), heavily modified to
;; support our use-case of remembering scroll positions on navigation
;; and scrolling back to proper positions when the back button is
;; pressed.

;; Here's an overview of how we achieve that and differences from
;; upstream pushy:

;; 1. Upstream pushy uses Google Closure Library's wrappers around the
;;    pushState API (goog.history); we forgo that and use pushState
;;    directly instead.  The reason is that goog.history doesn't
;;    support passing arbitrary state to history items.  See
;;    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API for
;;    an overview.

;; 2. We modify pushy to take a function that generates the history
;;    state (state-fn).  This function is then called directly before
;;    advancing to next page, and the resulting state is associated
;;    with history items.  On back-button navigation, the history state
;;    is passed as a second argument to dispatch-fn.

;; 3. Our history state is a JS object of the form {"scroll-position":
;;    274}. Our dispatch fn (set-page) passes that to the set-page
;;    event, which in turn sets it in app-db under ::db/scroll. After
;;    React re-renders our UI after navigation, the current-page
;;    component's :component-did-update lifecycle method sets the
;;    scroll position (wrapped in a requestAnimationFrame and a zero
;;    setTimeout to ensure that a full re-render has happened by the
;;    time it's called).

;; 4. If user click the back button, browser triggers onpopstate event
;;    and the dispatch-fn gets a non-null history state. In this case,
;;    we don't fire on-page-load events, which makes for a smoother
;;    user experience.
