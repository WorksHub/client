;; Here we overwrite the behavior of Bidi's wrt Pattern matching with sets.

;; multiple Alternates are provided, unmatching happens only on the first
;; alternative. We change this behavior to try and see if any of the supplied
;; alternatives has exactly the params that we supply. If we found some, we use
;; the first. If none are found, we revert to the original behavior.
