    :answer "Signing up to WorksHub is really easy. Just click “Get Started”, and we’ll get your dashboard set up with just a couple of clicks. From here if you select our Launch Pad or Take-Off plans you will be able to create as many jobs as you like across all of our hubs. You can also manage all of your applications and add colleagues to your account. Once signed up your jobs will be seen by a highly qualified pool of candidates — both full-time and contract — that are ready to interview now."}
   {:title "How does the trial work?"
    :answer (str "We offer a " launch-pad-trial-days "-day trial so you can get to know how our platform works and see some great candidates apply to your jobs. If you decide to interview a candidate you will be required to upgrade to one of our plans. If you hire a candidate before you upgrade to one of our plans or after you have cancelled you will be subject to our standard terms of service. This includes a 20% fee calculated on the hired candidates first year earnings.")}
   {:title "How much does Take-Off cost?"
    :answer "Depending on your company size and headcount goals, our Take-Off package is built to be flexible for you. Whether you're hiring two or two hundred, combining a subscription plan with a success fee will help give you access to our direct sourcing team to ensure you hit your hiring goals. Your account manager who you can find in your settings page will discuss the best option with you and create a custom pricing plan."}
   {:title "Are there discounts?"
    :answer "Yes! If you pay for six or three months in advance you save 10% or 5% compared to paying per month. You can see what that does to your monthly cost by changing the payment toggle on the top right of this page."}
   {:title "How do you vet your candidates?"
    :answer "In order to provide you with a high-quality pipeline, all candidates are approved before being given access to the WorksHub platform. To do this we use a combination of human and artificial curation to review all candidate profiles, both for experience, technical knowledge and their interest in finding a new job. We look at the type of roles the candidate is looking for, the location, skills, salary expectations and match that to the open positions across our platform. Because we focus on creating engaged and active candidates across our hubs, you can expect to see highly relevant candidates applying to your jobs."}
   {:title "GitHub integration, what does that do?"
    :answer "With one click you can connect your company GitHub account, allowing you to test, engage, and develop your own community of Software Engineers. With 84% of our users more open to joining a company whose open source they had already contributed to and 90% more likely to consider companies with open source code it’s a great way to increase your hiring pipeline. You can find out how to get started with connecting your GitHub and posting open source issues here."}
   {:title "How does WorksHub compare with Hired, Vettery, Triplebyte, and others?"
    :answer "Whether it’s hiring managers or CTOs looking to hire Software Engineers, our aim is to connect the right engineers with the right companies. When we decided to build WorksHub, we knew that in order to tackle the hiring problem, we needed a tech-first platform with a human touch for understanding nuance. Unlike competitors, we have built our hubs around specific technologies, ensuring you have no delay in gaining instant visibility for your company into the right (vetted) talent pools. With one account, you will be able to test, hire and engage candidates across all of our hubs."}])

These issues can be used to test, engage, and develop your own community of Software Engineers. With 84% of our users more open to joining a company whose open source they had already contributed to and 90% more likely to consider companies with open source code it’s a great way to increase your hiring pipeline."}

It allows you to build a community of engineers who are interested in the tech you are using and the work you are doing.  89% of the engineers on WorksHub want to work with open source software so It’s the quickest way to engage our talent pools."}
    {:title "How do I prepare my repositories?"
     :answer "In order to get contributions to your repo, our engineers will need to set up a basic build environment. We recommend setting up a detailed README that documents the pull request acceptance guidelines and how to set up the dev environment.  If you want feedback on your issues before pushing them live get in touch with the WorksHub team at: hello@works-hub.com\n"}
    {:title "How do I fund an issue and what do you charge for it?"
     :answer "If you wish to fund an issue, you can add a value to each individual issue.  Just head to your issue listings and edit the right issue.  Currently all issues will be value against $USD.   Once an issue has been completed and work approved you will be responsible for making the payment to the successful contributor.  This transaction will currently happen outside of the WorksHub platform and is the responsibility of issue maintainer and posting company. We are currently offering this as a free service for companies on our Essential, Launch Pad or Take Off plans."}]
   :candidate
   [{:title "How do I get started?"
     :answer "To complete an issue it’s easy, just find an issue that you find interesting and hit start work. Then follow these steps: Fork the repo, clone the project and you should then find setup instructions in README.  Take your time to complete the issue and once it’s ready submit your PR on GitHub and don't forget to link the issue to it.  Relax and wait for the maintainer to review your PR.  As soon as you start work on an issue the maintainer will be alerted via the WorksHub platform."}
    {:title "I want to work on an issue but someone else has already started?"
     :answer "We do not limit the number of people that can start work on an issue. You can see the number of contributors from the Issue page and the Issue listing page.  If you are concerned that your work might not get seen you can always comment on the issue and ask how the other contributors are getting on."}
    {:title "Why should I contribute?"
     :answer "Around 80% of the world’s companies run on some open source software. The future of our platform is to use this code as a way to test, engage and build engineering teams. In the meantime, if you want to provide value to your experience (beyond resume buzz words) or learn a new tech using production code then our issues are made for you.  We ask all company maintainers to write a repo README that makes it as easy as possible for new developers to set up and contribute."}
    {:title "How do I get paid for my work?"
     :answer "Only issues that indicate a value will result in you being paid for your work. The repo maintainer is solely responsible for the approval of your work and the pay out will be issued following approval. The company responsible for the issue retains the access to money and upon completion will transfer the money through Paypal or their payment provider of choice. In the future we hope to implement a solution in which the money is held in escrow with payments being released when work is merged."}]})
